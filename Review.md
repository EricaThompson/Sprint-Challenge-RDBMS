You can exercise your Google-Fu for this and any other _Sprint Challenge_ in the future.

1.  Explain the difference between `RDBMS` and `SQL`.
    
    -I haven't learned this but:
    - RDBMS = "A relational database management system (RDBMS) is a database management system (DBMS) based on the relational model invented by Edgar F. Codd at IBM's San Jose Research Laboratory."
    - SQL = "Structured Query Language is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS)."

    I'm not sure what those fully mean.


1.  Why do tables need a `primary key`?
    
    - Tables?? 
    - "Most probably you will need a unique index, and/or a clustered index (which is PK or not) depending on your need. "PRIMARY KEY constraints identify the column or set of columns that have values that uniquely identify a row in a table. No two rows in a table can have the same primary key value."

1.  What is the name given to a table column that references the primary key
    on another table.

    - Foreign Key?


1.  What do we need in order to have a _many to many_ relationship between two
    tables.
    - ??
    - "To avoid this problem, you can break the many-to-many relationship into two one-to-many relationships by using a third table, called a join table. Each record in a join table includes a match field that contains the value of the primary keys of the two tables it joins."


1.  What SQL statement is used to retrieve data from a table?
    - .get()?

1.  What SQL clause is used to filter the results of a query?
    - .sort()?
